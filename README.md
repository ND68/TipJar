# TipJar - A DeFi Tipping Widget
TipJar transforms traditional digital tipping into a transparent, gamified, and trustless payment system. Unlike sending crypto directly to a wallet, TipJar uses a Solidity smart contract to guarantee public record-keeping and instantaneous community recognition.

This project is built as an easily embeddable widget, allowing any creator, blogger, or service provider to drop a single line of code onto their website to accept tips in Ether.

## Core Features & Value Proposition

- Trustless Tipping: Eliminates payment processor fees and delays. Funds are transferred instantly and directly to the creator (minus only the blockchain gas fee).

- Immutable Leaderboard: All tips are recorded on a publicly verifiable ledger (the smart contract). The project's frontend aggregates this data into a dynamic Top Contributors leaderboard and a Live Tip Feed.

- Structured Feedback: Tippers can include a verifiable public message with their donation, enhancing the connection between the creator and their audience.

- Embeddable Component: The frontend is designed as a single, self-contained React component (TipJar.jsx) that can be integrated into any existing website with minimal effort, providing a seamless Web3 experience without requiring the host site to manage blockchain connections.
